WEBVTT

00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:19.750
You are trapped
in a distorted spell.

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.791
What were you looking for in my house?

00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:23.875
The Road.

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:32.625
Yes. Claw your way out.

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:44.791
How long have I been living
in this cesspool of a town?

00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:46.291
About three years.

00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:48.041
Wanda.

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:53.541
She took every little bit of power I had
and left me with household appliances.

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:56.250
We gotta get back on top.

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:59.541
If you're real, then that means...

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:06.875
Let me get my purple back.

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.333
And then come find me.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.083
I am not the only one
that wants to see you dead.

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:14.458
I expect you'll see them at sundown.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.708
...more of this nonsense!

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.166
Coming in here after all that time,
thinking she's gonna...

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.416
Look at my front door!

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.583
What?

00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:35.791
Ugh!

00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:40.541
Whose shoes are these?

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:46.250
Okay. She's unstoppable.

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.958
The house is yours, random boy.

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.291
Be sure to tell the vengeance-seekers
I said hi.

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:54.291
Take me to the Witches' Road!

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.708
Come again?

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:08.125
The Witches' Road.

00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:11.333
I want you to take me there.

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.166
Please?

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:15.583
The Witches' Road doesn't exist.

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:17.291
- You're lying.
- Am I?

00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:20.291
That's just what real witches say
to keep the amateurs out.

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:23.791
The Road will give you
the thing you want the most.

00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:25.083
If you make it to the end.

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:27.833
And I can. I will.

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:32.041
Hmm.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.416
The Road is no place for a kid.

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:42.291
- I'm 16!
- Oh, sorry. Teen.

00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:44.416
I don't know
where you heard about The Road...

00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:47.125
Books, the Ballad, legend, lore...

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.541
But it will kill you.

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:50.375
Didn't kill you.

00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:52.666
Well, I'm exceptional.

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:54.041
That's my point.

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:58.166
Okay, so, confession,
I know an egregious amount about you.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.000
I've been obsessed

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.250
- since I first read up on your Salem days.
- Hmm.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.791
One of my favorite "you" eras.

00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:05.375
That's a good one.

00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:07.000
That's why I came here last night.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.750
That's why I saved you
from the spell you were under.

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:13.583
No. It was my pleasure.

00:03:14.458 --> 00:03:16.666
Hmm. Well...

00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:24.875
If you've got the goods to break a spell
cast by the Scarlet Witch,

00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:27.791
why do you need The Road?

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:34.750
I mean, I've studied, don't get me wrong,

00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:37.875
but that can only take you so far.

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.458
I wanna blast, to shield, to levitate.

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:42.833
So you want a shortcut?

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:46.541
The Road promises
that what's missing awaits you at its end.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.041
Power is what I'm missing.

00:03:52.083 --> 00:03:54.041
Sounds like it's what you're missing, too.

00:03:58.083 --> 00:04:00.166
Nope. Too risky. No time.

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:02.375
If you wanna run, fine.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:05.208
But these people
who are coming tonight sound serious.

00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:08.000
You really think you can outrun them
with no magic at all?

00:04:28.041 --> 00:04:29.375
Who are you?

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.041
My name is...

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.166
Say again.

00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:46.166
I'm...

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:51.750
- Interesting.
- What?

00:04:53.708 --> 00:04:54.708
I'm driving.

00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:57.000
What? Really? Yes!

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
All right.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.333
Let's hit The Road.

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:07.041
Okay.

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:13.291
And this is not a car. Okay.

00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:15.541
That's all right. Yeah, it's totally fine.

00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:19.500
It's okay.
Just move on from this little thing. Oh!

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.041
Just what I was looking for. Uh...

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:25.625
You're driving.

00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:38.083
Miss Harkness! Miss Harkness!

00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:41.791
What do you know about covens?

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:46.333
Just that they're drawn together
by mysterious forces of fate,

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:48.833
and that they're the truest form
of sisterhood and...

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:51.666
Oh, my God. Are you taking me
to meet your coven?

00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:54.250
No. Those harpies are dust.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.333
But we do need a coven to access The Road.

00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:00.041
Right. Of course, that makes sense.

00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:02.791
It is the Witches',
plural possessive, Road.

00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:13.666
- I'm over here.
- Oh, are you?

00:06:40.875 --> 00:06:43.416
- Am I even going in the right direction...
- Be cool, man.

00:06:47.083 --> 00:06:48.166
Sorry.

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.208
- He worries.
- Aw!

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:54.083
So where do we just find a coven?

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.333
Wherever you are, a coven there shall be.

00:06:59.041 --> 00:07:00.083
That's beautiful.

00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:01.958
No. It's definitely not.

00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:04.875
But it is the Covenstead Rule.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.791
Within any three-mile radius,

00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:13.208
there will be a collection
of witchy-enough people to form a coven.

00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:16.375
Can you actually jot that down for me?

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:18.083
There's a pen in the glove compartment.

00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.375
Oh. Okay. Of course.

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:23.541
- Will this be...
- Yeah.

00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:24.625
- Perfect.
- Okay.

00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:28.083
- Right.
- Do you want me to take that?

00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:30.291
No, it's... I'll remember it.

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:37.875
So, with a Covenstead, it's unlikely
we'll find witches as high-profile as you.

00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:40.458
Yeah, there's no such thing, Teen.

00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.166
You know, but all we need
is a bit of talent.

00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:49.333
Even the most down-and-out witches,
when in close proximity with each other,

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:52.041
bring out a magical spark.

00:07:53.791 --> 00:07:56.208
- Ah. Stop.
- What?

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:57.791
Here. Now.

00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:04.500
You think
there's a real witch in there?

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.750
We'll see if she knows
the secret handshake.

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:09.166
No.

00:08:10.583 --> 00:08:12.833
I feel really optimistic about this.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.208
Welcome to the curious.

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:24.750
Good day, madam.

00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:28.458
Oh. Thank you so much for seein' us.

00:08:28.458 --> 00:08:31.625
We are hopin' for a miracle today.

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:34.666
This is my boy, Beauford.

00:08:34.666 --> 00:08:37.958
He doesn't talk much.
He's got social anxiety.

00:08:38.666 --> 00:08:42.583
His daddy recently passed,
and we miss him somethin' awful.

00:08:42.583 --> 00:08:46.166
And we surely would love
to commune with him today.

00:08:46.166 --> 00:08:48.250
But to be quite frank with you,

00:08:49.208 --> 00:08:53.541
what is top of mind
is the location of some gold bars

00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:56.125
he may or may not have buried
in our backyard.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.500
Please.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.791
Thank you. You're a doll.

00:09:05.125 --> 00:09:07.375
- How will you be paying?
- Oh.

00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:10.416
- He's got it.
- Debit works.

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:12.166
He always takes care of Mama.

00:09:12.833 --> 00:09:15.791
Hurry up, though. Okay?

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:19.458
- Your husband was a proud man.
- Oh.

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:22.125
- Indeed, he was.
- Did he golf?

00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:26.208
He died on the 18th hole.

00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:29.875
Oh. She's good.

00:09:31.041 --> 00:09:33.416
Now, the location of those gold bars?

00:09:45.166 --> 00:09:46.250
Brother.

00:09:48.833 --> 00:09:51.916
You'll find the gold bars
in an old bowling bag

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:53.666
at the back of his closet.

00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:57.166
Yes! That's it.

00:09:57.166 --> 00:10:00.166
Thank you. Thank the lady,
would you, please, Beauford?

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:02.000
There's something else.

00:10:04.666 --> 00:10:05.666
What is it?

00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:08.791
You've been
under the influence of another.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.916
- Someone you hurt.
- Ah!

00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:14.916
They took your agency.

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:18.000
For three years.

00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:22.875
It's not the first time
your witch kin betrayed you.

00:10:23.583 --> 00:10:24.916
But you survive.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.583
In a way few do.

00:10:28.416 --> 00:10:31.166
In fact, that's why you're here.

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:36.875
And I am not interested.

00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:40.333
- Wait, what?
- Thank you for your purchase.

00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:42.541
Your bank statement will say
"Lilia's Leggings,"

00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:44.375
but that's just my side hustle.

00:10:44.375 --> 00:10:46.000
[sighs in relief

00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:48.333
Lilia.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.458
Oh, you haven't even heard the pitch.

00:10:52.458 --> 00:10:53.875
I don't need to.

00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:59.041
What witch in her right mind
would join Agatha Harkness' coven?

00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:03.041
Not looking for right-minded witches,
as it happens.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Looks like we came to the right place.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Are you all right, ma'am?

00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:19.000
So you're a bit of a kook.
Every witch has their process.

00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:22.375
You showed some real skill out there.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.083
I didn't read your fortune.
I read your reputation.

00:11:26.208 --> 00:11:28.666
- Oh!
- Witches like you are the reason

00:11:28.666 --> 00:11:32.416
people think we poison apples,
and steal children, and eat babies.

00:11:32.416 --> 00:11:34.666
- Babies are delicious.
- Ugh!

00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:36.916
How old are you? 410? 415?

00:11:36.916 --> 00:11:39.958
- How dare you?
- Oh, I apologize.

00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.875
- You don't look a day under 450.
- Years old?

00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:47.041
You get, what, maybe two suckers a day
in here, and 20 bucks later,

00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:49.250
you're sitting on a bed
that's also your wall.

00:11:50.166 --> 00:11:52.041
Don't you miss the glory days?

00:11:52.041 --> 00:11:54.875
When I was chased
out of every village I passed through

00:11:54.875 --> 00:11:57.083
for accurately predicting tragedy?

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:59.750
No, I do not. Beat it, Harkness.

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:01.541
I'm gonna walk The Road.

00:12:11.916 --> 00:12:13.583
The Road is a death wish.

00:12:14.708 --> 00:12:15.708
I survived.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.291
Yeah? Where's your power now?

00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:21.125
Time to restock.

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:23.958
I need a Divination Witch.

00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.666
Are you honestly asking me

00:12:26.666 --> 00:12:31.416
to coven up with the single most
infamous witch on this continent?

00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:35.375
Oh, please. Name a badder bitch
in South America, or Europe.

00:12:35.375 --> 00:12:36.833
Who is this child?

00:12:36.833 --> 00:12:38.208
- I'm...
- My pet.

00:12:38.833 --> 00:12:41.333
This is my pet. Say hi, pet.

00:12:42.583 --> 00:12:43.583
Hi.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.500
You expect me to risk my life
on the Witches' Road,

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.375
- and if we're successful...
- When.

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:53.666
If we're successful,
watch you turn around and steal my power?

00:12:57.833 --> 00:12:58.833
Excuse me.

00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:04.125
So, little-known...

00:13:04.708 --> 00:13:07.000
No, don't worry about it.
It's fine. It's just us.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.708
Little-known fact about my ability...

00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:17.875
I can't steal your magic
unless you blast me with it.

00:13:21.083 --> 00:13:23.666
So if you show a little self-restraint,

00:13:23.666 --> 00:13:25.875
which, let's be honest,
you're gonna need to,

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.916
all that power is yours to keep.

00:13:37.375 --> 00:13:38.708
I found this on your door.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.583
The path you're currently on
leads nowhere.

00:13:47.041 --> 00:13:48.458
- Join me.
- Us.

00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:53.666
And return
to your former clairvoyant glory.

00:13:58.666 --> 00:13:59.791
If you two stay any longer,

00:13:59.791 --> 00:14:01.958
I'm going to have to start
charging you again.

00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:11.875
- What is happening?
- Witchcraft.

00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:26.041
Three of Pentacles.

00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:33.166
There. A list of four names.

00:14:34.083 --> 00:14:36.625
Looks like you've got your coven.
Leave me out of it.

00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:38.708
You're on here.

00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:42.958
What?

00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:45.250
Can't say no to you.

00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:49.458
Agatha's address.

00:14:51.708 --> 00:14:54.500
Be there at 5:00.
Plenty of street parking.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.833
That was amazing.

00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:06.000
And we got a team roster
out of the deal, too.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.791
So who's next?

00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:22.208
Agatha?

00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:25.291
What?

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.416
Who's next on the list?

00:15:28.375 --> 00:15:29.375
Uh...

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.083
Ugh!

00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:34.208
Taste.

00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:37.750
I'm being serious, ladies.

00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:41.041
Mmm.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.250
Divine, right?

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.333
- So good.
- Yum.

00:15:45.333 --> 00:15:46.583
I know.

00:15:46.583 --> 00:15:51.583
My probiotic candles are perfect for both
ambiance and metabolic regulation.

00:15:52.708 --> 00:15:54.708
I am obsessed with these.

00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:57.291
Especially because
you do have to burn them before ingestion.

00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:58.625
It's an FDA thing.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.166
But also, mandatory zen time!

00:16:01.166 --> 00:16:04.208
Hey! Where do you keep your jade eggs?

00:16:04.708 --> 00:16:08.625
I'm fresh out of marbles,
and my pelvic floor is all over the place.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.833
Actually, you gals wanna
go splitsies on one?

00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:16.125
Hmm? Anyone? Anyone?

00:16:16.125 --> 00:16:18.291
Sisterhood of the traveling Kegels?

00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:20.041
No? No?

00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:21.166
Hi, Jen!

00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:24.041
God, Agatha! I haven't seen you

00:16:24.041 --> 00:16:26.875
since I made a really pointed effort
to never run into you again.

00:16:28.833 --> 00:16:31.458
- So good.
- How are you? Awful?

00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:34.541
I'm assembling a coven.
I need a Potions guy.

00:16:34.541 --> 00:16:36.583
We're gonna walk The Road.

00:16:37.916 --> 00:16:38.916
You're serious?

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.791
It's a dead end. Literally.

00:16:42.791 --> 00:16:44.666
Oh, come on, Jen.

00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:49.291
I'm offering you the chance
to finally lift the binding spell

00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:53.666
that has kept you magic-less
for the last... What, century?

00:16:53.666 --> 00:16:55.708
- You look amazing.
- I know.

00:16:56.291 --> 00:16:58.500
- What do you care about my magic?
- I...

00:17:00.458 --> 00:17:01.833
Oh!

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.000
You lost the Darkhold,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.958
and now you're powerless and exposed.

00:17:07.166 --> 00:17:09.208
How far you've fallen, witch killer.

00:17:09.791 --> 00:17:11.250
At least I'm still a witch.

00:17:12.125 --> 00:17:14.791
Like I care about that dusty,
warty, snaggle-toothed community.

00:17:14.791 --> 00:17:17.458
Oh, you don't fool me.

00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:20.250
You'd chew off your own acrylics
to get back into the club.

00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:23.625
Ugh! I'm not gonna waste my breath
illuminating the obvious.

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:25.166
Have fun healing the healthy.

00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.416
Hi. I love your Insta page, by the way.

00:17:28.416 --> 00:17:30.458
You totally minimized
the size of my pores.

00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:32.083
Who's this?

00:17:32.916 --> 00:17:34.291
Another child sacrifice?

00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:38.375
I'm really sorry
about your recent legal troubles.

00:17:40.666 --> 00:17:41.875
Yes, I'm aware.

00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:46.166
"Fraudulent misrepresentation
resulting in consumer injury."

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:49.458
I personally would not consider
superficial burns "injury,"

00:17:49.458 --> 00:17:52.500
but apparently,
some people needed skin grafts.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.541
Oh, Jen!

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:58.125
- I haven't been convicted of anything.
- Yet.

00:17:58.666 --> 00:18:01.833
Historically, we as a group
don't do well in courtrooms.

00:18:01.833 --> 00:18:04.208
The charge has
a surprisingly lenient penalty,

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:07.291
just, like, payouts
and maybe, like, five years in prison.

00:18:07.833 --> 00:18:09.791
But 800 counts of it?

00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:11.916
[Starts to get a little life-y!

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:17.250
Wait. So you're magically bound,
and you're about to get literally bound.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.958
None of this pedestrian drama would be
an issue for a powered-up witch.

00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:25.875
You think I haven't tried everything
to unbind, you freaky little miscreant?

00:18:25.875 --> 00:18:27.125
Hey!

00:18:27.666 --> 00:18:29.416
You've tried everything but The Road.

00:18:30.458 --> 00:18:32.083
If you value your freedom,

00:18:32.833 --> 00:18:34.750
join us here, tonight.

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:39.166
Oh!

00:18:40.166 --> 00:18:41.625
Gonna take a jade egg to go.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.000
You'll know where to find it.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:46.958
Thank you.

00:18:49.583 --> 00:18:50.833
Two down. Two to go.

00:18:50.833 --> 00:18:52.750
- Just one, actually.
- What?

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.083
- Yeah.
- Lilia said four names.

00:18:54.083 --> 00:18:55.583
- No.
- Let me see. Let me see.

00:18:55.583 --> 00:18:56.666
What are you...

00:18:57.833 --> 00:18:59.250
- Very mature.
- Come on, Teen.

00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:01.708
- Wasting daylight.
- Okay.

00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:05.833
- I can't believe you actually ate that.
- Ate what?

00:19:05.833 --> 00:19:09.125
Now I'm actually hungry.
I could use a corn dog.

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:13.125
Do you see her?
Do you know what she looks like?

00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:14.875
She's a Blood Witch.

00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:16.875
A Blood Witch is...

00:19:16.875 --> 00:19:18.208
Child of a witch.

00:19:18.208 --> 00:19:23.708
In this case, her mom was a witch
and also a famous goddess of rock.

00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:26.958
Lorna Wu?

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.750
- As in Lorna Wu and the Coral Shore?
- Take it easy.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.875
She wrote the most famous version
of the Ballad.

00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:35.375
My mom went to see her last tour
right before she died. RIP.

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:38.625
I bid on a limited edition
signed LP of the Ballad,

00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:41.625
but it cost more than I make
in a whole summer at the Hokey Pokey Bowl.

00:19:41.625 --> 00:19:44.541
I don't wanna ever hear
those words paired together again.

00:19:57.791 --> 00:19:59.041
Let's go.

00:20:01.708 --> 00:20:03.875
You're just gonna... Fine.

00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:09.208
You think we're gonna find
Lorna Wu's daughter at the Westview Mall?

00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:14.416
I feel like she'll be somewhere cooler,
like Brooklyn or a yacht.

00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:18.250
Rumor has it
Lorna Wu was lost to the Witches' Road.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.458
- What?
- I know. Ironic.

00:20:20.458 --> 00:20:23.166
- More like iconic.
- No.

00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:28.583
I know I have an aesthetic,
but what are we doing here?

00:20:29.333 --> 00:20:30.333
Run.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
- Run?
- Run!

00:20:34.041 --> 00:20:36.791
Whoa!

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:38.750
Alice Wu Gulliver?

00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:41.791
I'm Agatha Harkness.
This is my familiar, Toto.

00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:44.791
We need a Protection Witch
to join us on the Witches' Road.

00:20:44.791 --> 00:20:46.416
What do you say?

00:20:46.416 --> 00:20:48.416
- What?
- Gulliver!

00:20:48.416 --> 00:20:50.375
Sir, this woman just assaulted my nephew!

00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:53.208
- Did you just tackle a teenager?
- Yeah, I saw them lift something.

00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:55.375
No, he didn't touch anything.
Check his pockets.

00:20:55.375 --> 00:20:56.916
- Search me.
- He didn't do anything.

00:20:56.916 --> 00:20:59.500
Your old lieutenant convinced me
to give you a shot,

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.750
but you've been nothing but bad luck.
You're fired.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.291
What divine intervention is this?

00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:08.583
You're out of a job
and we're setting off for The Road today.

00:21:08.583 --> 00:21:11.000
- People like you are dangerous.
- Agreed.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.416
- But The Road?
- The Road isn't real.

00:21:13.416 --> 00:21:16.125
You groupies don't get it.
It's just a stupid song.

00:21:16.583 --> 00:21:19.708
Um, forty million copies worldwide
beg to differ.

00:21:19.708 --> 00:21:20.916
The Road is real.

00:21:20.916 --> 00:21:22.625
- Agatha's been there.
- And back.

00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:25.750
The Road is a myth. It's a con. A cult.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.250
Yeah. But what if it isn't?

00:21:28.791 --> 00:21:31.041
What if you could finally
answer the question

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:33.958
that has been haunting you
for most of your life?

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.125
"What happened to Mommy?"

00:21:51.208 --> 00:21:53.375
- She's a tough nut to smash.
- Crack.

00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:57.916
I didn't even
get to give her your address.

00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:00.250
We don't need her.

00:22:01.291 --> 00:22:02.333
Come on.

00:22:04.208 --> 00:22:05.208
Hey!

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:08.208
We've got about an hour until sunset.

00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:11.000
Are you sure two witches are enough?

00:22:12.625 --> 00:22:15.000
How far away is The Road?
Like, what's the drive time?

00:22:18.083 --> 00:22:19.083
Where are you from?

00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:22.500
Me? Originally? I mean,

00:22:23.083 --> 00:22:25.875
I was born and raised in Eastview...

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.125
[It's nice to get to know
each other a little bit.

00:22:53.583 --> 00:22:54.833
Drive faster.

00:22:54.833 --> 00:22:56.583
What? Okay.

00:23:40.208 --> 00:23:42.500
Don't be nervous. They'll show. I know it.

00:23:43.291 --> 00:23:45.333
- Does this look centered?
- Let me see.

00:23:45.333 --> 00:23:48.583
Maybe if I just
put it a little more to the...

00:23:50.125 --> 00:23:51.708
No, leave it up.

00:23:52.291 --> 00:23:54.541
It really elevates the space.

00:23:56.041 --> 00:23:57.416
Oh, God, am I the first to arrive?

00:23:57.416 --> 00:23:59.041
The rest will be here soon.

00:23:59.041 --> 00:24:01.500
Please come in. Right, Agatha?

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.583
I don't care.
Yeah, whatever she would like.

00:24:03.583 --> 00:24:07.791
Can I interest you
in a pre-Road appetizer?

00:24:08.416 --> 00:24:11.875
They are old granola bars.
I didn't have much to work with.

00:24:11.875 --> 00:24:13.166
I ate before I came.

00:24:13.166 --> 00:24:16.500
I don't mind a lapsed expiration date.

00:24:18.875 --> 00:24:20.208
High priestess.

00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:21.708
Jennifer Kale, Potions.

00:24:21.708 --> 00:24:23.458
Lilia Calderu, Divination.

00:24:24.083 --> 00:24:26.125
- You're bound.
- And you need a chemical peel.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.958
This is never gonna work.

00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:33.083
- Your front door is missing.
- Alice!

00:24:33.083 --> 00:24:34.791
- How did you...
- I'm an ex-cop.

00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:36.875
That's gonna be the answer
to a lot of questions.

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:40.166
Well, gang's all here. Let's hit The Road.

00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:42.583
Wait. Where's our Green Witch?

00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:46.541
- Oh, do we really need one of those?
- Of course we do.

00:24:46.541 --> 00:24:49.208
- Says who?
- The Ballad.

00:24:49.208 --> 00:24:52.791
-"Wake thy power, earthly and divine."
- No, I've heard it.

00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:55.958
Earth magic is arguably
the most important skill set

00:24:55.958 --> 00:24:57.458
for an attempt at The Road.

00:24:58.041 --> 00:24:59.458
Getting cold feet already, Jen?

00:25:00.541 --> 00:25:03.416
Well, there was one more name
on the coven list.

00:25:04.083 --> 00:25:05.083
Wasn't there?

00:25:07.458 --> 00:25:09.958
- Lilia's handwriting is so bad...
- What was the last name?

00:25:12.208 --> 00:25:14.333
It wasn't a name. It was a heart.

00:25:15.208 --> 00:25:16.250
A heart?

00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:19.625
A black heart.

00:25:20.666 --> 00:25:23.791
That's because you used a black pen.

00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:29.416
Oh!

00:25:30.291 --> 00:25:31.500
I know who it is.

00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:33.666
I'll just go get her.

00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:35.791
Be back in a flash.

00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:49.416
Yoo-hoo!

00:25:51.708 --> 00:25:52.958
Agnes?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.875
Well, you look fabulous!

00:25:56.875 --> 00:25:59.875
- Thank you, Mrs. Hart.
- No, no, no.

00:25:59.875 --> 00:26:03.041
- It's Mrs. Davis, dear. No.
- Oh, right.

00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:07.416
Mrs. Hart was what Wanda branded me,

00:26:07.416 --> 00:26:08.833
you know.

00:26:08.833 --> 00:26:10.375
My name is Sharon.

00:26:10.375 --> 00:26:13.958
I know you get confused sometimes
but my real name is Sharon.

00:26:13.958 --> 00:26:16.000
Right. Well, there's no time for details.

00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:20.166
Oh, have I commented
on how beautiful your garden is recently?

00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:22.666
Well, no, you have not.

00:26:22.791 --> 00:26:25.666
It's just me and my green thumb.

00:26:26.291 --> 00:26:29.000
But I'll tell you the secret
to fluffy azaleas.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.166
So, I was just wondering

00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:32.875
if you'd like to come
to a little party I'm having tonight.

00:26:32.875 --> 00:26:35.208
A party? Really?

00:26:35.208 --> 00:26:36.750
- Yeah!
- I haven't been to a party

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.416
- since Mr. Davis passed away...
- Are you in or you out, Hart?

00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:43.500
Oh, well, I think I'm just...
I'm gonna grab my purse.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.875
Oh, a party!

00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:48.958
Should I get the car?

00:26:48.958 --> 00:26:50.916
Some people might need
to squeeze in the back.

00:26:52.208 --> 00:26:56.625
You don't drive to The Road, Teen.
The Road is conjured.

00:26:57.416 --> 00:26:58.458
Oh.

00:26:58.458 --> 00:27:00.708
So, um, are we doing laundry together?

00:27:00.708 --> 00:27:03.541
Why don't you head upstairs
and let us just do our thing, okay?

00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:06.583
Close some windows while you're at it,
'cause it feels a little drafty.

00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:09.500
- Okay, but you'll let me know...
- Yep. Yeah. Scoot. Scoot.

00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:16.041
Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.833
So, all we need to do is sing the Ballad,

00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:25.041
and a door will appear,

00:27:25.666 --> 00:27:31.750
and we'll be on our merry way to having
all of our magical dreams come true.

00:27:32.916 --> 00:27:35.166
Okay? All aboard?

00:27:35.708 --> 00:27:37.125
So, who's going high?

00:27:37.666 --> 00:27:40.208
Oh, no, thank you. I don't take drugs.

00:27:40.208 --> 00:27:43.416
- She's talking about the harmonies.
- I'm an alto is all I'm saying.

00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:44.791
Get off me!

00:28:02.958 --> 00:28:04.166
Hey, I got you.

00:28:05.958 --> 00:28:07.208

Well, if she wasn't so pitchy.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.583
- Says the voice flatter than a pancake.
- Yeah, did you not hear you?

00:31:50.583 --> 00:31:52.416
'Cause the voice does not match the dress!

00:31:52.416 --> 00:31:54.125

- Agatha!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:17.166
What's going on up there?

00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:19.083
Are there any real witches in the house?

00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:21.291
Because all I see
are has-beens and could've-beens.

00:32:21.291 --> 00:32:22.666
You recruited us.

00:32:22.666 --> 00:32:26.000
And I was a fool.
You can forget the Witches' Road.

00:32:26.583 --> 00:32:32.208
I'd die before letting you befoul it
with your noxious mediocrity.

00:32:33.458 --> 00:32:37.083
What a team of rejects.

00:32:37.083 --> 00:32:38.625
Coward.

00:32:39.125 --> 00:32:41.375
Fraud. Disappointment.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.666
I'd say you should burn
like the rest of them

00:32:44.666 --> 00:32:46.541
but that would be a waste of kindling.

00:32:46.541 --> 00:32:47.958
- Enough.
- You need to shut up.

00:32:47.958 --> 00:32:50.416
- Go to hell!
- Make me!

00:32:51.875 --> 00:32:53.208
Wait!

00:32:53.208 --> 00:32:55.708
This is a power grab.
She wants us to attack her.

00:32:55.708 --> 00:32:57.583
- What?
- You brought us here

00:32:57.583 --> 00:33:00.083
hoping our proximity,
coupled with your cruelty,

00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:03.125
would get you a spark you could steal.
You had no intention

00:33:03.125 --> 00:33:05.458
- of bringing us on The Road.
- It's not my fault

00:33:05.458 --> 00:33:08.208
only a true coven can open the door.

00:33:10.208 --> 00:33:14.166
Oh, I don't have time for this!
Just blast me, you bitches!

00:33:14.708 --> 00:33:15.708
What is that?

00:33:22.416 --> 00:33:23.500
Was that there before?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.083
No.

00:33:27.041 --> 00:33:28.125
Open it.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.750
Oh, my God!

00:33:34.541 --> 00:33:35.666
No!

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.250

00:34:03.625 --> 00:34:05.791
Agatha!

00:34:06.416 --> 00:34:07.666
Is this it? Is this The Road?

00:34:07.666 --> 00:34:09.958
Because we should
really, really go, like, right now.

00:34:11.333 --> 00:34:12.625
No, thank you.

00:34:13.208 --> 00:34:15.416
No way I'm sticking around
for whatever that is.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.750
- Well, I...
- What does your gut tell you?

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:19.125
Oh.
