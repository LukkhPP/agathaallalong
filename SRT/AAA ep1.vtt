00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.083
Another beautiful day.

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.666
Hey, neighbor.

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.583
Surprised to see you out here, Detective.

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:25.041
There I was, sitting on my duff,
playing Candy Crush, happy as a clam,

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:28.291
enjoying the fruits
of my undeserved disciplinary action...

00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:29.583
You punched a suspect.

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:32.916
Oh, now a convicted felon.
I can't be right and wrong

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:34.375
- at the same time.
- Yes, you can.

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:37.166
When the Chief calls and tells me,
"Hibernation's over.

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.208
"Got a case only you can solve."

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:41.625
Direct quote.

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:44.375
So?

00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:48.791
Jane Doe.
Found her down here by the water.

00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:51.583
Dispatch was tipped off
by an anonymous call.

00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:53.708
Mmm. Somebody
didn't want her out here alone.

00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:56.416
This is all she had on her.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.875
What's this? From a library book?

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:00.041
Westview branch.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.750
Mmm-hmm.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.583
- Cause?
- Blunt force trauma.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.583
Not much of a drop around here. She fall?

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:08.416
- She was crushed.
- By what?

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:10.333
Something big. And heavy.

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:12.500
So she didn't die here.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.250
She is dead, though, isn't she, Herb?

00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:17.583
Oh, she's really, most sincerely dead.

00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:20.166
You never know.

00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:47.208
Get samples from both.

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:28.625
Find something?

00:03:30.666 --> 00:03:31.875
Nah.

00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:33.750
They're set to roll her. You ready to see?

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:35.833
Let's go.

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:03.083
Who are you?

00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:07.041
What happened to you?

00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:12.750
You okay, Agnes?

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.250
How do you mean?

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:22.458
You don't seem like yourself.

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:23.583
Oh, yeah?

00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:27.166
And who is that exactly?

00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:32.250
I'll try to be more cheerful
for you next time, Herb.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.833
But right now this unidentified woman
lying dead in a creek

00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:37.625
has just got me down in the dumps.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.041
Let me know
when the dental records come in.

00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:58.291
♪ Down, down, down the road ♪

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.500
♪ Down the winding road ♪

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:06.458

Ah. Official police business.

00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:32.625
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:34.458
- Excuse me.
- Jeez.

00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:38.250
You use that line
at the supermarket checkout, too?

00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:40.625
Only suckers wait their turn.

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:42.166
How can I help you, Agnes?

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:43.666
Found this on a victim.

00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:48.166
Ooh. Who's the victim? Is she dead?

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:50.541
Now, why do you assume it's a woman?

00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:54.000
I don't know. Sounds more titillating.

00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:58.333
- There are no names on here.
- But there are dates.

00:05:58.333 --> 00:06:02.708
We don't use cards anymore.
Everything's digital now. Sorry.

00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:06.916
Well, thanks a bunch for your help,
Dottie. You've been an absolute angel.

00:06:06.916 --> 00:06:08.958
Incidentally, where were you
last night

00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:11.250
between the hours of 1:00
and 3:00 a.m.?

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.333
I guess I could run the book title.

00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:14.916
Oh, can you?

00:06:17.666 --> 00:06:21.166
"Dialogue And Rhetoric: Known History
Of Learning & Debate, by Andrew Ugo."

00:06:21.166 --> 00:06:23.000
Yeah, I'm thinking erotic thriller?

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:26.250
- Huh.
- Huh, what?

00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958
This book wasn't checked out.
It was stolen. Three years ago.

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.000
But we have plenty more copies
in Natural Sciences.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.541
Now, if you'll excuse me...

00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:38.958
Yeah, I'll excuse you.

00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:12.916
There was a fire.

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:19.041
Was everything destroyed?

00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:22.583
Every last copy.

00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:50.666
- Morning, Detective.
- Good mornin'.

00:07:57.375 --> 00:07:58.375
Wow.

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:02.375
- Thank you.
- Glad to have you back, Agnes.

00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:06.166
Glad to be back, Chief.
And, no, I do not accept your apology.

00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:07.916
Yeah, so, Agnes...

00:08:07.916 --> 00:08:09.916
- You hear what happened at the library?
- No, I...

00:08:09.916 --> 00:08:11.833
- Somebody torched one of the stacks.
- No.

00:08:11.833 --> 00:08:14.750
- Like, took a flame thrower to it.
- Oh, yeah?

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.166
I'll have one of the guys follow up.
But listen, Agnes...

00:08:17.166 --> 00:08:19.250
- You got a spot on your shirt.
- Oh.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.041
- And your tie.
- Ah, cripes.

00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:23.291
You makin' breakfast smoothies
again, Chief?

00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:26.166
You know you're supposed to put the lid on
before you blend it.

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:28.041
Yes, I know. Um...

00:08:28.916 --> 00:08:30.000
Listen, Agnes...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.916
You're about to tell me
somethin' I'm not gonna like.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.541
Soil samples from under the fingernails
and toenails of the Jane Doe came back.

00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:40.125
They don't match
the soil she was lyin' in.

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:44.000
That's no surprise.
We assumed she'd been moved.

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:47.541
There were traces
of a particular microbial sediment

00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:49.000
only found in Eastern Europe.

00:08:49.583 --> 00:08:51.583
Now get to the part I'm not gonna like.

00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:52.708
Here I am.

00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:00.833
Okay.

00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:03.875
Fancy dirt always attracts the attention
of the Feds.

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:06.541
Agent Vidal is an asset here, Agnes.

00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:10.875
More brain power and more resources mean
you get to the finish line faster.

00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:12.125
Strength in numbers.

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:14.500
- Teamwork makes the dream...
- Eat my ass, Chief.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.333
I'll leave you to it, then.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.291
- It's been a long time.
- What are you doing here?

00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:36.958
My job.

00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.125
You wanna take control
of my investigation.

00:09:41.083 --> 00:09:42.083
No.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:47.541
If you wanna be in control, you can be.

00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:51.375
She...

00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:54.458
The body was moved across state lines.
Is that your play?

00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.541
Is this really how you see yourself?

00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:03.791
Sure. Let's talk about the case.

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:07.250
What are your theories?
How'd she end up in the ravine?

00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:09.750
No drag marks.
Thinking the perp carried her.

00:10:10.458 --> 00:10:16.583
Uh... Seems logical. But you don't really
believe that because... Oops.

00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:18.875
No tracks for the perp.

00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:21.708
Not a leaf disturbed
before Forensics showed up.

00:10:21.708 --> 00:10:24.458
It's almost like
she just magically appeared.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:29.000
Let's stick
to reality here, yeah?

00:10:29.666 --> 00:10:32.250
- Sure.
- If there's one thing we can agree on,

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.333
it's that these cases are always
about the place.

00:10:35.833 --> 00:10:37.583
The specific small town,

00:10:37.583 --> 00:10:41.750
the history of it, the people in it,
the secrets buried beneath it.

00:10:42.416 --> 00:10:44.666
That's where the answers lie.

00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:53.958
Well, who better to solve the mystery
than one of Westview's very own?

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.416
Yeah, you've lived here your whole life.

00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:02.041
Isn't that true... Agnes?

00:11:13.708 --> 00:11:14.875
I don't want you here.

00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:37.208
Oh, it's real,
all right. And it's a beaut.

00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:38.375
Where'd you get it?

00:11:38.375 --> 00:11:41.208
Mind your beeswax, Norm.
Where's it from? How old is it?

00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.083
North American. New England, maybe.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.416
Late 17th century, I guess.
It's made from cowrie shell.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.625
What's a cowrie?

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:51.000
Sea snail.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.375
And these hotties here.
That's Triple Goddess.

00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:55.791
Maiden, Mother, Crone.

00:11:55.791 --> 00:11:58.791
What, no Working Professional Goddess?

00:11:59.541 --> 00:12:00.541
Oh, hello.

00:12:01.666 --> 00:12:03.791
Looks like your brooch is a locket.

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:07.250
You looking to sell it, Agnes?

00:12:10.041 --> 00:12:11.458
How much you offering, Norm?

00:12:12.583 --> 00:12:13.583
For you?

00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:15.583
Two hundred.

00:12:15.583 --> 00:12:18.333
Great. Now I know
where to start the bidding on eBay.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.250
Good to see you, too, Agnes.

00:13:06.708 --> 00:13:07.708
Go home, Agnes.

00:13:10.875 --> 00:13:12.291
I am home, Chief.

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:18.250
- Hey!
- Go home.

00:13:45.916 --> 00:13:46.916
Stupid dog.

00:14:51.666 --> 00:14:52.750
What?

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.333
Did you know that
it is a universally-acknowledged truth

00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:57.208
that a lady cop cannot be good at her job

00:14:57.208 --> 00:14:59.375
and have a healthy personal life
at the same time?

00:15:01.708 --> 00:15:02.708
Hungry?

00:15:03.875 --> 00:15:07.125
So she's a rookie, granted,

00:15:07.125 --> 00:15:09.541
but I say to her,

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:12.958
"Has the suspect been seen
in the last 24 hours?"

00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.833
And she says, "Only on TikTok."

00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:18.833
And then I say,
"Well, did you learn anything?"

00:15:18.833 --> 00:15:19.916
And she says,

00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:24.166
"That I was totally using
the wrong foundation brush."

00:15:34.708 --> 00:15:35.708
Anyway...

00:15:41.291 --> 00:15:42.791
I have a lead in the case.

00:15:43.541 --> 00:15:45.125
That's not why I came over.

00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:49.666
But go ahead.

00:15:52.458 --> 00:15:56.208
There was a car wreck,
about an hour before time of death.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.333
- Where?
- Eastview.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Eastview?

00:16:01.583 --> 00:16:04.250
See, I thought you turned into a pumpkin
that far afield.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.750
Hey, I travel. I'm worldly.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.916
Where have you traveled?

00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:17.291
Okay, so what about the car wreck?

00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:22.625
Bloodstain in the back seat.

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:25.208
You think that's how they moved her?

00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:27.708
Front two airbags deployed.

00:16:28.291 --> 00:16:30.416
- Maybe two perps?
- Maybe.

00:16:30.708 --> 00:16:32.791
But you don't like it.

00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.791
My gut tells me they're related,

00:16:36.833 --> 00:16:39.208
but I can't shake this feeling
I'm seeing it wrong.

00:16:46.833 --> 00:16:48.333
Can I ask you something?

00:16:49.625 --> 00:16:50.625
Yeah.

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:54.041
Do you remember why you hate me?

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:03.166
No.

00:17:03.875 --> 00:17:05.375
Are you hiding evidence?

00:17:06.041 --> 00:17:07.041
No.

00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:12.250
Well, you're only lying to yourself.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.416
Hey! What are you doing?

00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:37.166
What did you take?

00:17:38.833 --> 00:17:39.958
You gotta be kidding me.

00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.708
Don't move! Freeze! Here we go.

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:48.000
Whoa!

00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:50.875
Crap, crap, crap.

00:17:51.791 --> 00:17:53.125
Hey! Where are you...

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.791
Stop! Police!

00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:01.416
Don't you run from me!

00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:07.125
Stop!

00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:09.166
Police!

00:18:11.333 --> 00:18:12.750
Hey! Hey!

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.500
Stop!

00:18:31.375 --> 00:18:34.000
Hey. Hey, you okay? You okay?

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.583
Oh, my God. He came out of nowhere.

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.333
Ma'am, get back in your vehicle!

00:18:41.541 --> 00:18:42.708
You alive?

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.000
Good. 'Cause I'm arresting you now.
And I want you real alert for that.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.125
All right, come on.

00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:53.375
Well, he won't give his name
and he's not in the system.

00:18:53.375 --> 00:18:56.333
First offense.
He take anything from your place?

00:18:56.333 --> 00:18:58.833
No, but not for lack of trying.

00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.875
I think it's time
for a good old-fashioned chat

00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:03.416
with Edward Scissorhands in there.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.291
Go get your perp.

00:19:20.291 --> 00:19:21.416
So I'm curious.

00:19:22.583 --> 00:19:26.083
What compelled you to break into
the home of a decorated detective?

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:29.750
When you say "decorated,"
do you mean suspended without pay?

00:19:32.833 --> 00:19:34.458
Yeah, I know who you are.

00:19:37.666 --> 00:19:39.708
Let's talk about you, then,
you little dirtbag.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.416
Is B&E your regular gig?

00:19:45.583 --> 00:19:46.791
Hmm?

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:50.625
'Cause you're crap at it.

00:19:52.375 --> 00:19:54.416
What were you looking for in my house?

00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:58.375
The respect of your peers
and a fulfilling home life.

00:19:58.916 --> 00:20:00.708
But you were fresh out of both.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.500
See...

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.208
The things that you're roasting me for

00:20:18.791 --> 00:20:20.916
are the things that make me dangerous.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.291
So you wanna keep poking the bear?

00:20:30.583 --> 00:20:31.583
Good.

00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:34.125
Now...

00:20:43.125 --> 00:20:44.208
What were you after?

00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:48.333
The Road.

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:50.541
What road?

00:20:51.916 --> 00:20:53.625
You, of all people, should know.

00:21:02.666 --> 00:21:05.666
What? It's ink from the fingerprinting.

00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:10.750
I was on a road this morning.

00:21:12.916 --> 00:21:14.791
It led to something pretty awful.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.375
New question.

00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:25.250
Where were you last night
between the hours of 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.?

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.833
Asleep. In bed.

00:21:39.416 --> 00:21:43.416
"Asleep in bed."

00:21:43.416 --> 00:21:46.708
Total loser?

00:21:47.833 --> 00:21:51.875
Or totally lying?

00:21:51.875 --> 00:21:54.875
Let's find out.

00:21:57.625 --> 00:21:59.791
- What do you know about this?
- Nothing. Nothing!

00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:01.333
- Tell me who she is.
- I don't know.

00:22:01.333 --> 00:22:02.750
Tell me what happened to her!

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.208
What are you talking about?
These are just flowers!

00:22:06.083 --> 00:22:07.083
What?

00:22:09.666 --> 00:22:12.458
They're just pictures
of someone's front yard or something!

00:22:19.875 --> 00:22:21.625
Why do you keep looking at that painting?

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:23.708
It's not a...

00:22:32.208 --> 00:22:34.208
What are you saying?

00:22:36.208 --> 00:22:37.208
What is that?

00:22:39.833 --> 00:22:40.833
Stop it.

00:22:41.458 --> 00:22:42.875
Get up! Get up!

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.958
You know what?
You're spending the night in the tank.

00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:48.750
Let's see how long you can keep that up.

00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:00.083
There was a body.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.375
I saw the body.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.291
I'm not crazy.

00:23:06.916 --> 00:23:08.541
She was there. She was there.

00:23:42.291 --> 00:23:46.708
She was in her late 20s, green eyes, 5'7".

00:23:54.708 --> 00:23:56.625
Hair the color of...

00:24:00.333 --> 00:24:01.416
Scarlet.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.666
Case closed, then?

00:24:35.416 --> 00:24:36.875
How did she die?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.500
Wrong question.

00:24:40.541 --> 00:24:42.916
That witch is gone.

00:24:42.916 --> 00:24:45.500
And all of the copies of the Darkhold
with her.

00:24:46.208 --> 00:24:48.458
Leaving you trapped
in her distorted spell.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.458
But you don't have to stay there, do you?

00:24:56.875 --> 00:25:00.125
Is it hot? Are you?

00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:02.625
Yes. Claw your way out.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.791
I'm hot. Is it hot?

00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:08.833
I'm feeling...

00:25:12.208 --> 00:25:13.333
Good.

00:25:28.625 --> 00:25:29.791
What?

00:25:53.333 --> 00:25:55.750
There are two Jane Does in this case,

00:25:57.916 --> 00:25:59.541
and you know her name.

00:26:01.208 --> 00:26:02.875
So, what's yours?

00:26:56.958 --> 00:26:58.666
All right. There we go.

00:27:00.666 --> 00:27:03.458
Oh! Whoa!

00:27:03.458 --> 00:27:05.666
What? What is going on?

00:27:06.875 --> 00:27:08.083
Hey, Miss Agnes.

00:27:08.083 --> 00:27:10.000
- You feeling okay today?
- Stop talking.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.166
How long have I been here?

00:27:11.166 --> 00:27:13.500
Uh... What?

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.166
How long have I been living
in this cesspool of a town?

00:27:18.166 --> 00:27:19.583
You don't remember?

00:27:21.666 --> 00:27:22.833
Catch me up.

00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:24.458
About three years.

00:27:25.708 --> 00:27:27.958
Three years?

00:27:30.916 --> 00:27:31.916
Wanda.

00:27:32.416 --> 00:27:33.875
- We try not to say her name.
- Ugh!

00:27:34.541 --> 00:27:37.833
Because you're cowards,
because you're sheep.

00:27:37.833 --> 00:27:39.708
What have I been doing all this time?

00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:43.458
Well, you've mostly been a good neighbor.
A bit too casual with your boundaries...

00:27:43.458 --> 00:27:45.458
Call me "nosy," I'll cut out your tongue.

00:27:45.458 --> 00:27:46.875
Yeah.

00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:49.208
You haven't been yourself
the past few days.

00:27:49.208 --> 00:27:51.750
Almost like you got bit
by the true crime bug.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.500
So...

00:27:54.041 --> 00:27:58.791
So what? I've just been spouting nonsense

00:27:58.791 --> 00:28:00.916
and you've just been humoring me?

00:28:00.916 --> 00:28:03.250
I mean, folks been trying to help out,
you know,

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.625
stopping by and bringing you groceries

00:28:06.208 --> 00:28:07.333
and checking up on you.

00:28:07.333 --> 00:28:09.000
- Oh, my God.
- Just do something!

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.708
- Oh, I get it.
- Just get her inside.

00:28:10.708 --> 00:28:13.500
Librarian. Chief of police.

00:28:14.625 --> 00:28:16.500
- What are you doing? No.
- Nothing.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.625
Oh! Jeweler.

00:28:19.625 --> 00:28:20.708
Okay.

00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:24.583
This is where hope goes to die.

00:28:24.583 --> 00:28:25.916
You know, um...

00:28:27.041 --> 00:28:29.458
Okay. Besides the fact that you're, um...

00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:33.291
You seem pretty lucid for a change.

00:28:33.291 --> 00:28:35.833
Aggressive, even. Powerful.

00:28:38.166 --> 00:28:39.166
What did you say?

00:28:39.666 --> 00:28:42.833
I said, "Powerful," but look, Agnes, if...

00:28:42.833 --> 00:28:44.500
It's Agatha.

00:28:45.833 --> 00:28:47.875
Okay. Agatha. Yeah.

00:28:47.875 --> 00:28:50.125
Can you put on some clothes?

00:28:50.125 --> 00:28:52.125
'Cause you... 'Cause you're naked.

00:29:05.208 --> 00:29:07.125
Okay.

00:29:07.125 --> 00:29:08.958
No. No!

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.000
I got mugged, mister.

00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:52.333
She took every little bit of power I had
and left me with household appliances.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.125
We gotta get back on top.

00:30:35.458 --> 00:30:39.125
So that arrest was maybe
more of a kidnapping.

00:30:40.166 --> 00:30:45.291
But if you're real
and not a figment of my imprisoned mind,

00:30:46.083 --> 00:30:47.083
then that means...

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.583
I've missed you.

00:31:15.583 --> 00:31:16.916
I hate you.

00:31:16.916 --> 00:31:18.750
How long has it been, Agatha?

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.625
- Not sure.
- Since you acquired the Darkhold,

00:31:22.583 --> 00:31:24.625
you hid behind all that dark magic,

00:31:25.333 --> 00:31:26.750
but then you lost it.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.500
And now...

00:31:32.708 --> 00:31:33.708
Touch.

00:31:36.083 --> 00:31:37.166
You're vulnerable.

00:31:38.958 --> 00:31:40.333
Only physically.

00:32:02.916 --> 00:32:04.125
Do you remember pain?

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.916
It kind of tickles, doesn't it?

00:32:13.125 --> 00:32:14.666
Coochie coochie coo.

00:32:20.875 --> 00:32:25.208
You can't kill me. It's not allowed.

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:38.541
Maybe I can't kill you,

00:32:39.083 --> 00:32:41.000
but I can make you wish you were dead.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.833
Wait, wait, wait.

00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:46.833
This isn't what you want.

00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:52.125
Me without power.

00:32:55.583 --> 00:32:58.333
This is undignified.

00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:01.291
Don't you want me at my best?

00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:07.375
Admit it. You prefer me...

00:33:07.375 --> 00:33:10.500
Horizontal, in a grave.

00:33:11.583 --> 00:33:12.708
Formidable.

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:14.666
So take my power.

00:33:15.833 --> 00:33:18.666
That's cute.
But you know that would kill me.

00:33:19.666 --> 00:33:22.458
Just let me get my purple back.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.875
And then come find me.

00:33:25.458 --> 00:33:27.916
I am not the only one
that wants to see you dead.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.500
Wants to see you burn.

00:33:31.208 --> 00:33:34.166
Or hang or drown.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.208
There are no new options?

00:33:37.666 --> 00:33:39.916
I could just sit back and watch.

00:33:41.041 --> 00:33:42.083
Come on.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.125
You love it.

00:33:50.375 --> 00:33:51.833
The anticipation.

00:33:58.041 --> 00:33:59.041
Okay, Agatha.

00:34:02.916 --> 00:34:04.958
But I'll be sure to tell them
where to find you.

00:34:08.541 --> 00:34:11.541
Who, specifically?

00:34:11.708 --> 00:34:15.291
Mmm! The worst of them. The Salem Seven.

00:34:15.791 --> 00:34:18.083
I expect you'll see them at sundown.

00:34:19.291 --> 00:34:20.708
After all these centuries,

00:34:22.708 --> 00:34:26.416
Agatha Harkness will finally meet her end.

00:34:26.416 --> 00:34:29.250
- Ugh! It really warms the heart.
- You don't have a heart.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:31.291
Yes, I do.

00:34:31.291 --> 00:34:34.458
It's black. And it beats for you.

00:35:00.416 --> 00:35:02.625
